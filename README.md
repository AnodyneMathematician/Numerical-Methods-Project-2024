Group Project for class MATH2064 (Numerical Methods) on finding the most efficient method of computing eigenvalues values between QR and Arnoldi methods. 

Packages Required:
1. Linear Algebra - For Matrix Operations, and comparing results to eigenvalues obtained by in-built eigenvalue solvers.
2. Distributions - For Randomness to initialize sparsity.
3. BenchmarkTools - For Benchmarking Performance of Functions.
4. PlotlyJS - For Contour Plots.
(Nota Bene: Contour Plot's require additional dependencies to view in Jupyter notebooks; we therefore have provided the contour plots in a .jl file to avoid this issue, to be viewed in your preferred IDE).

Respository is intended to remain public only while the marking process is undergoing.
